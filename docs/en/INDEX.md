CMS Dark Theme
===============================================
# how it works

There are three settings:

1. let browser decide
2. _site config_ default setting for all users
3. _user_ specific settting

If (3) is not set, it will look at (2) and then look at (1). The user can set their own setting in their profile (`/admin/myprofile`). 

On the left menu in the CMS, the option will show to switch until the user has made a decision.
